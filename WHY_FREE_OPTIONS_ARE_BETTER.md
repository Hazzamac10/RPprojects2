# Why Free Options Are Better for Your Website (And Their Drawbacks)

## 🤔 Why a Proper Server Setup Isn't Worth It for RP PROJECTS

### Your Website's Needs:
- ✅ Simple contact form
- ✅ Low to medium traffic (probably 10-50 form submissions/month)
- ✅ Just need to receive emails
- ✅ No complex features needed

### What a Proper Server Gives You (That You Don't Need):
- ❌ **Database storage** - You don't need to store submissions (emails are enough)
- ❌ **Complex APIs** - You just need simple email sending
- ❌ **Multiple endpoints** - One form, one endpoint
- ❌ **Advanced features** - No need for user accounts, payments, etc.
- ❌ **High traffic handling** - You're not getting millions of requests
- ❌ **Custom infrastructure** - Overkill for a contact form

### The Real Costs of a Proper Server:

**Time Investment:**
- Setup: 2-4 hours initially
- Maintenance: 1-2 hours/month (updates, security patches)
- Monitoring: Check logs, fix issues
- **Total: ~20-30 hours/year**

**Money Investment:**
- VPS: $5-10/month = $60-120/year
- Domain email: $0-6/month = $0-72/year
- **Total: $60-192/year**

**Complexity:**
- Need to learn server management
- Handle security updates
- Monitor for issues
- Backup management
- **Stress and complexity you don't need**

### What You Actually Need:
- ✅ Send email when form is submitted
- ✅ Receive email in your inbox
- ✅ That's it!

**A proper server is like buying a Formula 1 race car to drive to the grocery store.**
